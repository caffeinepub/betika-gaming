  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all six requirements (REQ-42 through REQ-47) for the 20% tax deduction feature. Backend changes include adding tax fields to deposit and winning records, computing tax in deposit/release functions, and providing a migration script. Frontend changes include displaying tax breakdowns in DepositSection, AdminFundsReleaseSection, and AdminPage release history table. All components show gross amounts, 20% tax deductions, and net amounts with proper KES formatting.",
