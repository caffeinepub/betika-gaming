  "summary": "The diff shows extensive modifications to profile-related files and backend code, but most profile components and utilities appear to still exist (as modified files rather than removed files). The key gap is that required file removals were not executed—components and utilities were modified or left in place instead of being deleted. The migration.mo file was added (not requested), and backend migration logic was applied (not requested in detail).",
