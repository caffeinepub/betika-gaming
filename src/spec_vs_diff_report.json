  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements successfully. REQ-54 (inline authentication prompt), REQ-56 (one-click login), REQ-57 (loading feedback), and REQ-58 (prominent login button) are fully implemented. However, REQ-55 (automatic login persistence) appears to be missing - there is no evidence of automatic authentication on page load for returning users with active sessions.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-55",
      "requirement": "Add automatic login persistence that immediately authenticates users when they return to the application if they have an active Internet Identity session, without requiring manual login",
      "reason": "No implementation found for automatic authentication on page load. The App.tsx and LoginButton.tsx show authentication state checking but no automatic login attempt for returning users with valid sessions. The code checks if identity exists but does not trigger automatic login during app initialization.",

    {
      "description": "AccessDeniedScreen component shows feature highlights grid with multiple benefit cards (Secure Authentication, Manage Payouts, etc.)",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only requested an inline authentication prompt with benefits explanation and sign-in button, not a detailed feature highlights grid. The implementation added extra UI elements beyond the specification.",
