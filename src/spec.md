## Summary
**Goal:** Implement an easy-to-use login system with prominent login/logout options and clear authentication state indication.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a prominent login button to the main application interface that triggers Internet Identity authentication
- Update the AccessDeniedScreen component to provide a streamlined login experience with clear call-to-action messaging
- Add persistent login state indication in the application header showing user identity or a user menu
- Add an easily accessible logout option for logged-in users

**User-visible outcome:** Users can easily log in using a prominent login button, see their authentication status in the application header, and log out when needed. The login experience is streamlined with clear messaging and visible authentication state.
